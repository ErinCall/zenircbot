Copy the .js.dist files to .js and edit their values in order to setup
this bot.

You'll need to install the node library `redis` (installed via npm) to
run the base bot. github.js relies on `express` (installed via npm)
and jira_feed.py relies on `BeautifulSoup<4.0`, `feedparser` and
`redis` (installed via pip or easy_install)

To start it, run `node bot.js`.

You'll find interesting services in `services/` and you can run them
using their respective interpreter.

ZenIRCBot uses redis to communicate via pub/sub. The bot writes
everything to the redis channel `out` and reads what to say from the
redis channel `in`.
