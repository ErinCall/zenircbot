-------

ZenIRCBot is covered by an MIT license, any code contributed will be
required to be covered by this license as well.

Issues
------

The GitHub issue tracker is the prefered method of reporting an
issue. Please do not apply any tags or milestones, I will do that
myself when I triage the issue.

Code
----

If you write code and would like it integrated with the code base
please follow the following steps:

#. Fork the repo
#. Create a branch in your repo
#. Do you bug fix/feature add/hackery
#. Send a pull request from that branch
#. Do not delete your fork until the pull request has been accepted or
   declined in such a way that you do not want to continue development on it.
